        <h3>Here are some ingredients you would need to prepare</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>1 medium 8.8oz. (.25Kg) flat iron steak (top blade shoulder steak)</li>
                <li>2 cup milk (preferably whole, called "4%")</li>
                <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        </div>  
        <h3>Here are some instructions on how to Prepare:</h3>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a medium sized saucepan.</li>
                <li>Heat up the mixture, stirring until the honey has completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to the boil.</li>
                <li>Carefully place the steak in the boiling milk mixture.</li>
                <li>
                    Bring the liquid back to the boil and reduce the heat so that the milk is simmering.</li>
                    <li>Cook this medium-sized steak for five minutes on one side, stirring the top occasionally to stop a skin forming on the milk.</li>
                    <li>Turn the steak over and cook for a further five minutes on the other side.</li>
                    <li>
                        Check how well cooked your steak is. If you're after authenticity, the steak should be cooked "over hard" and so should not be pink at all.</li>
                        <li>Allow the steak to rest for a few minutes.</li>
                        <li>Garnish with jelly beans.</li>
                        
            </ol>
